# Blockly for CodeWorld Blocks
Modified to support Blocks for [CodeWorld](https://github.com/google/codeworld).
This Blockly is used to build a block environment for a functional language.

This fork uses further changes from the following users:

* [awmorph](https://github.com/awmorp) with [his Blockly
  fork](https://github.com/awmorp/blockly) for math
  expressions.
* [slerner](https://github.com/slerner) with [his Blockly
  fork](https://github.com/UCSD-PL/typed-blockly) that
  supports better types and polymorphism.
